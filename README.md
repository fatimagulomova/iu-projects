## DLBSEPCP01_E — Cloud Programming
### Task 1: Host a simple webpage on AWS
Design and implement a highly available, low-latency website on AWS using Amazon S3 bucket for hosting and CloudFront for content delivery using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform for reproducibility. The goal of the task is to host an “index” HTML file, guaranteeing high availability, minimizing latency, and enabling auto-scaling for optimal performance.

## DLBAIPCV01 — Project: Computer Vision
### Task 2: Recognizing Objects in Video Sequences
This project aims to develop a computer vision system that accurately detects and segments objects in video. I used state-of-the-art object detection and segmentation algorithms. Firstly, I implemented three SoA approaches: YOLO, SSD, and Faster R-CNN and evaluated their performance. Then, I analysed the results visually and highlighted their strengths and weaknesses. Next, I determined the best-performing approach based on evaluation and analysis. Link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NdpVsZzHaaUc4d0PXXzEveJfNaLGTQd4?usp=sharing
