# Recognizing Objects in Video Sequences using YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN, and SSD in Python

## Description

This project demonstrates object detection and segmentation on video sequences using three state-of-the-art models: **YOLOv8**, **Faster R-CNN**, and **SSD**. It compares the models in terms of speed, accuracy, and efficiency to provide insights into their strengths and weaknesses. The project processes video frames, applies detection, and generates annotated output videos.
